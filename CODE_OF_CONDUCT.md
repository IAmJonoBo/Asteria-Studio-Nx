# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the project maintainers as described in `SUPPORT.md`.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the
   nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was
   inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No
   interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
   those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public
   communication with the community for a specified period of time.
4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any interaction or public
   communication with the community.
